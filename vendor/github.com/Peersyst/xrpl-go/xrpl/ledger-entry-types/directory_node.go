// The DirectoryNode ledger entry type provides a list of links to other entries in the ledger's state data.
// A single conceptual Directory takes the form of a doubly linked list, with one or more DirectoryNode entries
// each containing up to 32 IDs of other entries.
// The first DirectoryNode entry is called the root of the directory, and all entries other than the root can be added or deleted as necessary.
//
// DirectoryNode entries can have the following values in the Flags field:
// - lsfNFTokenBuyOffers: This directory contains NFT buy offers.
// - lsfNFTokenSellOffers: This directory contains NFT sell offers.
//
// Owner directories and offer directories for fungible tokens do not use flags; their Flags value is always 0.
//
// There are three kinds of directory:
// - Owner directories list other entries owned by an account, such as RippleState (trust line) or Offer entries.
// - Offer directories list the offers available in the decentralized exchange. A single Offer directory contains all the offers that have the same exchange rate for the same token (currency code and issuer).
// - NFT Offer directories list buy and sell offers for NFTs. Each NFT has up to two directories, one for buy offers, the other for sell offers.

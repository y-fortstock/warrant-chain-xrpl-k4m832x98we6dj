// (Not to be confused with the "ledger hash" string data type, which uniquely identifies a ledger version.
// This section describes the LedgerHashes ledger object type.)
//
// The LedgerHashes object type contains a history of prior ledgers that led up to
// this ledger version, in the form of their hashes. Objects of this ledger type are
// modified automatically when closing a ledger. (This is one of the only times a
// ledger's state data is modified without a transaction or pseudo-transaction.)
// The LedgerHashes objects exist to make it possible to look up a previous ledger's
// hash with only the current ledger version and at most one lookup of a previous
// ledger version.
//
// There are two kinds of LedgerHashes object. Both types have the same fields. Each
// ledger version contains:
//   - Exactly one "recent history" LedgerHashes object
//   - A number of "previous history" LedgerHashes objects based on the current ledger index
//     (that is, the length of the ledger history). Specifically, the XRP Ledger adds a new
//     "previous history" object every 65536 ledger versions.

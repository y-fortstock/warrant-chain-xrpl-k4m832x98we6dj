// Claim XRP from a payment channel, adjust the payment channel's expiration, or both. This transaction can be used differently depending on the transaction sender's role in the specified channel:
//
// The source address of a channel can:
//
// - Send XRP from the channel to the destination with or without a signed Claim.
// - Set the channel to expire as soon as the channel's SettleDelay has passed.
// - Clear a pending Expiration time.
// - Close a channel immediately, with or without processing a claim first. The source address cannot close the channel immediately if the channel has XRP remaining.
//
// The destination address of a channel can:
//
// - Receive XRP from the channel using a signed Claim.
// - Close the channel immediately after processing a Claim, refunding any unclaimed XRP to the channel's source.
//
// Any address sending this transaction can:
//
// - Cause a channel to be closed if its Expiration or CancelAfter time is older than the previous ledger's close time. Any validly-formed PaymentChannelClaim transaction has this effect regardless of the contents of the transaction.
//

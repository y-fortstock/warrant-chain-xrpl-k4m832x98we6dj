	// These codes indicate that the transaction failed, but it was applied to a ledger to apply the transaction cost. They have numerical values in the range 100 to 199. It is recommended to use the text code, not the numeric value.

	// Transactions with tec codes destroy the XRP paid as a transaction cost, and consume a sequence number. For the most part, the transactions take no other action, but there are some exceptions. For example, a transaction that results in tecOVERSIZE still cleans up some unfunded offers. Always look at the transaction metadata to see precisely what a transaction did.
